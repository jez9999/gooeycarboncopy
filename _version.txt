Carbon Copy VERSION
===================

Places where we need to update the version number when we're changing the version of our
build:
- In the Carbon Copy project Assembly Information; both 'Assembly Version' and 'File Version'
  should be the same.  This is the authoritative current version of Carbon Copy.
- In the Inno Setup install file (install.iss), 'AppVerName' needs to reflect the
  version number.

NOTE:
Although we display 4 parts to the version number because 'Assembly Version' and 'File
Version' do, we only use two of them; the last two numbers should always be zero ('0.0').
