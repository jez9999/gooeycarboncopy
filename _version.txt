Carbon Copy VERSION
===================

This version of Carbon Copy is: 2.1.1.0

Places where we need to update the version number when we're changing the version of our
build:
- This file, just above.  :-)
- In the Carbon Copy project Assembly Information; both 'Assembly Version' and 'File
  Version' should be the same.
- In the Inno Setup install file (install.iss), 'AppVerName' needs to reflect the
  version number.
