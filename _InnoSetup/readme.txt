Carbon Copy INNO SETUP DATA
===========================

In order to install Carbon Copy on Windows, we've created an Inno Setup script
(install.iss) that can be used to generate a setup.exe installer via the Inno Setup
compiler.  The Inno Setup compiler can be downloaded from:
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Once Inno Setup has compiled the installer, it will be output to "Output\mysetup.exe"
in the current directory.
